# Profile


4th year electronics and computer systems engineering student at Victoria University of Wellington, heavily invested in developing and diversifying myself as a future engineer. Take initiative through trying new things and creating challenges. Currently doing my honours project which aims to produce a quantitative model of the Eight360 NOVA's power system. Recently started developing an algorithmic trading system with a mean win-rate of 71% utilising engineering strategies and would like to apply my understanding of control systems, computer science, and electronics to the technology industry. Due to NDAs and IP agreements some of the projects mentioned will not be available on Github.

# Vision

I am interested in learning how to leverage FPGAs for services including, VHDL design, C++/Python implementation of High Frequency Trading Strategies for market markers, in addition to studying algorithmic trading methods. Furthermore, I am currently enrolled in a digital programmable logic course to further my understanding of low latency systems.
