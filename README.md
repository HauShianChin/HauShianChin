# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hau Shian Chin

4th year computer engineering student at Victoria University of Wellington, heavily invested in developing and diversifying myself as a future engineer. Take initiative through trying new things and creating challenges. Currently doing my honours project which aims to produce a quantitative model of the Eight360's NOVA. Recently developed an algorithmic trading system with a mean win-rate of 71% using engineering strategies and would like to apply my
understanding of control systems, computer science, and electronics to the technology industry

# Passion

I am interested in learning how to leverage FPGAs for services including, VHDL design, C++/Python implementation of High Frequency Trading Strategies for market markers, as well as algorithmic trading methods.
